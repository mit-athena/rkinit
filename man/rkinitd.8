.SH NAME
rkinitd \- server for 
.I rkinit,
a remote ticket establishment utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rkinit [-notimeout]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I rkinitd
is the server for 
.I rkinit. 
See rkinit(1) for information about
.I rkinit.
.I rkinitd
can be started either from the commandline or by inetd.  In either
case it must be run as root or be installed setuid root 
as it does a setuid(2) call before establishing tickets, attempts
to bind to a privileged port, and needs to be able to read
/etc/srvtab. 

.I rkinitd
normally times out in 30 seconds.  Invoking 
.I rkinitd
with the 
.I -notimeout
flag will override this behavior.

If you wish to run 
.I rkinitd
from inetd, you should install the following line in inetd.conf:

atest6	dgram	udp	wait	unswitched	root	
.br
/site/local/rtbin/rkinitd	rkinitd

.I rkinitd 
must be running on a machine with a srvtab containing an rcmd.<host>
key. 

.SH BUGS
Only one 
.I rkinit
can be run to a given server at a time.  This is because 
.I rkinitd
does not make any effort to keep track of where requests are coming
from or what the nature of the requests are.

.SH FUTURE EXPANSION
It might be good for the user running 
.I rkinit 
to be able to specify the
name of the ticket file and for
.I rkinitd 
to be smarter about where to put tickets owned by root.
